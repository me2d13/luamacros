   These APIs allow you to find another plugin or yourself, or iterate across 
   all plugins.  For example, if you wrote an FMS plugin that needed to talk 
   to an autopilot plugin, you could use these APIs to locate the autopilot 
   plugin.

 * INTERPLUGIN MESSAGING
 ___________________________________________________________________________}
{
   Plugin messages are defined as 32-bit integers.  Messages below 0x00FFFFFF 
   are reserved for X-Plane and the plugin SDK.   
   
   Messages have two conceptual uses: notifications and commands.  Commands 
   are  sent from one plugin to another to induce behavior; notifications are 
   sent  from one plugin to all others for informational purposes.  It is 
   important that commands and notifications not have the same values because 
   this could cause a notification sent by one plugin to accidentally induce a 
   command in another. 
   
   By convention, plugin-defined notifications should have the high bit set  
   (e.g. be greater or equal to unsigned 0x8000000) while commands should have 
   this bit be cleared. 
   
   The following messages are sent to your plugin by x-plane.

 * Plugin Features API

   The plugin features API allows your plugin to "sign up" for additional

   behavior. 
   
   Each feature is defined by a permanent string name.  The feature string 
   names will vary with the particular  installation of X-Plane, so plugins 
   should not expect a feature to be guaranteed present.
