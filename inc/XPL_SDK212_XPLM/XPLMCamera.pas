   XPLMCamera - THEORY OF OPERATION The XPLMCamera APIs allow plug-ins to 
   control the camera angle in X-Plane.  This has a number of applications, 
   including but not limited to: 
   
   - Creating new views (including dynamic/user-controllable views) for the 
   user. 
   
   - Creating applications that use X-Plane as a renderer of scenery, 
   aircrafts, or both. 
   
   The camera is controlled via six parameters: a location in OpenGL 
   coordinates and pitch, roll and yaw, similar to an airplane's position.  
   OpenGL coordinate info is described in detail in the XPLMGraphics 
   documentation; generally you should use the XPLMGraphics routines to 
   convert from world to local coordinates.  The camera's orientation starts 
   facing level with the ground directly up the negative-Z axis  
   (approximately north) with the horizon horizontal.  It is then rotated 
   clockwise for yaw, pitched up for positive pitch, and rolled clockwise 
   around the vector it is looking along for roll. 
   
   You control the camera either either until the user selects a new view or  
   permanently (the later being similar to how UDP camera control works).  You 
   control the camera by registering a callback per frame from which you 
   calculate the new camera positions.  This guarantees smooth camera motion. 
   
   Use the XPLMDataAccess APIs to get information like the position of the 
   aircraft, etc. for complex camera positioning.

    This structure contains a full specification of the camera.  X, Y, and Z 
    are the camera's position in OpenGL coordiantes; pitch, roll, and yaw are 
    rotations from a camera facing flat north in degrees.  Positive pitch means 
    nose up, positive roll means roll right, and positive yaw means yaw right, 
    all in degrees. Zoom is a zoom factor, with 1.0 meaning normal zoom and 2.0 
    magnifying by 2x (objects appear larger).

    You use an XPLMCameraControl function to provide continuous control over 
    the camera.  You are passed in a structure in which to put the new camera

    surrender control of the camera; camera control will be handled by X-Plane 
    on this draw loop. The contents of the structure as you are called are 
    undefined. 
    
    If X-Plane is taking camera control away from you, this function will be 
    called with inIsLosingControl set to 1 and ioCameraPosition NULL.
