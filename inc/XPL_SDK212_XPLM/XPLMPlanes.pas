    This structure contains additional plane parameter info to be passed to

    knew about when compiling your plugin (since more fields may be added 
    later). 
    
    Most of these fields are ratios from 0 to 1 for control input.  X-Plane 
    calculates what the actual controls look like based on the .acf file for 
    that airplane.  Note for the yoke inputs, this is what the pilot of the 
    plane has commanded (post artificial stability system if there were one) 
    and affects aelerons, rudder, etc.  It is not  necessarily related to the 
    actual position of the plane!

    XPLMAcquirePlanes grants your plugin exclusive access to the aircraft.  It 
    returns 1 if you gain access, 0 if you do not. inAircraft - pass in an 
    array of pointers to strings specifying the planes you want loaded.  For 
    any plane index you do not want loaded, pass a 0-length string.  Other 
    strings should be full paths with the .acf extension.  NULL terminates this 
    array, or pass NULL if there are no planes you want loaded. If you pass in 
    a callback and do not receive access to the planes your callback will be 
    called when the airplanes are available. If you do receive airplane access, 
    your callback will not be called.
