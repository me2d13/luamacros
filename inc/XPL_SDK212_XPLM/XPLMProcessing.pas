   This API allows you to get regular callbacks during the flight loop, the 
   part of X-Plane where the plane's position calculates the physics of 
   flight, etc.  Use these APIs to accomplish periodic tasks like logging data 
   and performing I/O. 
   
   WARNING: Do NOT use these callbacks to draw!  You cannot draw during flight 
   loop callbacks.  Use the drawing callbacks (see XPLMDisplay for more info) 
   for graphics.

    XPLMFlightLoopID
    
    This is an opaque identifier for a flight loop callback.  You can use this 
    identifier to easily track and remove your callbacks, or to use the new 
    flight loop APIs.

   {
    XPLMFlightLoop_f
    
    This is your flight loop callback.  Each time the flight loop is iterated 
    through, you receive this call at the end.  You receive a time since you 
    were last called and a time since the last loop, as well as a loop counter. 
    The 'phase' parameter is deprecated and should be ignored.				 
    
    Your return value controls when you will next be called. Return 0 to stop 
    receiving callbacks.  Pass a positive number to specify how many seconds 
    until the next callback.  (You will be called at or after this time, not 
    before.)  Pass a negative number to specify how many loops must go by until 
    you are called.  For example, -1.0 means call me the very next loop.  Try 
    to run your flight loop as infrequently as is practical, and suspend it 
    (using return value 0) when you do not need it; lots of flight loop 
    callbacks that do nothing lowers x-plane's frame rate. 
    
    Your callback will NOT be unregistered if you return 0; it will merely be 
    inactive. 
    
    The reference constant you passed to your loop is passed back to you.

    This routine schedules a flight loop callback for future execution.  If

    the absolute value of the input.  If the interval is positive, it is a 
    duration in seconds.

    routine is called; otherwise they are relative to the last call time or the 
    time the flight loop was registered (if never called). 
    
    THREAD SAFETY: it is legal to call this routine from any thread under the 
    following conditions: 
    
    1. The call must be between the beginning of an XPLMEnable and the end of 
    an XPLMDisable sequence.  (That is, you must not call this routine from 
    thread activity when your plugin was supposed to be disabled.  Since 
    plugins are only enabled while loaded, this also implies you cannot run 
    this routine outside an XPLMStart/XPLMStop sequence.) 
    
    2. You may not call this routine re-entrantly for a single flight loop ID.  
    (That is, you can't enable from multiple threads at the same time.) 
    
    3. You must call this routine between the time after XPLMCreateFlightLoop 
    returns a value and the time you call XPLMDestroyFlightLoop.  (That is, you 
    must ensure that your threaded activity is within the life of the object.  
    The SDK does not check this for you, nor does it synchronize destruction of 
    the object.) 
    
    4. The object must be unscheduled if this routine is to be called from a 
    thread other than the main thread.
