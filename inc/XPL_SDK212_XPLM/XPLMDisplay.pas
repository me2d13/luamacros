{
   XPLM Display APIs - THEORY OF OPERATION 
   
   This API provides the basic hooks to draw in X-Plane and create user 
   interface. All X-Plane drawing is done in OpenGL.  The X-Plane plug-in 
   manager takes care of properly setting up the OpenGL context and matrices.  
   You do not decide when in your code's  execution to draw; X-Plane tells you 
   when it is ready to have your plugin draw. 
   
   X-Plane's drawing strategy is straightforward: every "frame" the screen is 
   rendered by drawing the 3-d scene (dome, ground, objects, airplanes, etc.)  
   and then drawing the cockpit on top of it.  Alpha blending is used to 
   overlay the cockpit over the world (and the gauges over the panel, etc.). 
   
   There are two ways you can draw: directly and in a window. 
   
   Direct drawing involves drawing to the screen before or after X-Plane 
   finishes a phase of drawing.  When you draw directly, you can specify 
   whether x-plane is to complete this phase or not.  This allows you to do 
   three things: draw before x-plane does (under it), draw after x-plane does 
   (over it), or draw instead of  x-plane. 
   
   To draw directly, you register a callback and specify what phase you want 
   to intercept.  The plug-in manager will call you over and over to draw that 
   phase. 
   
   Direct drawing allows you to override scenery, panels, or anything.  Note 
   that  you cannot assume that you are the only plug-in drawing at this 
   phase. 
   
   Window drawing provides slightly higher level functionality.  With window 
   drawing you create a window that takes up a portion of the screen.  Window 
   drawing is always two dimensional.  Window drawing is front-to-back 
   controlled; you can  specify that you want your window to be brought on 
   top, and other plug-ins may put their window on top of you.  Window drawing 
   also allows you to sign up for  key presses and receive mouse clicks. 
   
   There are three ways to get keystrokes: 
   
   If you create a window, the window can take keyboard focus.  It will then 
   receive all keystrokes.  If no window has focus, X-Plane receives 
   keystrokes.  Use this to implement typing in dialog boxes, etc.  Only one 
   window may have focus at a time; your window will be notified if it loses 
   focus. 
   
   If you need to associate key strokes with commands/functions in your 
   plug-in, use a hot key.  A hoy is a key-specific callback.  Hotkeys are 
   sent based on virtual key strokes, so any key may be distinctly mapped with 
   any modifiers.  Hot keys  can be remapped by other plug-ins.  As a plug-in, 
   you don't have to worry about  what your hot key ends up mapped to; other 
   plug-ins may provide a UI for remapping keystrokes.  So hotkeys allow a 
   user to resolve conflicts and customize keystrokes. 
   
   If you need low level access to the keystroke stream, install a key 
   sniffer.  Key sniffers can be installed above everything or right in front 
   of the sim.

 * DRAWING CALLBACKS
 ___________________________________________________________________________}
{
   Basic drawing callbacks, for low level intercepting of render loop. The 
   purpose of drawing callbacks is to provide targeted additions or  
   replacements to x-plane's graphics environment (for example, to add extra 
   custom objects, or replace drawing of the AI aircraft).  Do not assume that 
   the drawing callbacks will be called in the order implied by the 
   enumerations. Also do not assume that each drawing phase ends before 
   another begins; they may be nested.

   {
    XPLMDrawingPhase
    
    This constant indicates which part of drawing we are in.  Drawing is done 
    from the back to the front.  We get a callback before or after each item. 
    Metaphases provide access to the beginning and end of the 3d (scene) and 2d 
    (cockpit) drawing in a manner that is independent of new phases added  via 
    x-plane implementation. 
    
    WARNING: As X-Plane's scenery evolves, some drawing phases may cease to  
    exist and new ones may be invented.  If you need a particularly specific 
    use of these codes, consult Austin and/or be prepared to revise your code 
    as X-Plane evolves.

    Upon entry the OpenGL context will be correctly set up for you and OpenGL 
    will be in 'local' coordinates for 3d drawing and panel coordinates for 2d

    This is the prototype for a low level key-sniffing function.  Window-based 
    UI _should not use this_!  The windowing system provides high-level 
    mediated keyboard access.  By comparison, the key sniffer provides low 
    level keyboard access. 
    
    Key sniffers are provided to allow libraries to provide non-windowed user  
    interaction.  For example, the MUI library uses a key sniffer to do pop-up 
    text entry. 
    
    inKey is the character pressed, inRefCon is a value you supply during 
    registration. Return 1 to pass the key on to the next sniffer, the window 
    mgr, x-plane, or whomever is down stream.  Return 0 to consume the key. 
    
    Warning: this API declares virtual keys as a signed character; however the 
    VKEY #define macros in XPLMDefs.h define the vkeys using unsigned values 
    (that is 0x80 instead of -0x80).  So you may need to cast the incoming vkey

    XPLMHandleCursor_f
    
    The SDK calls your cursor status callback when the mouse is over your 
    plugin window.  Return a cursor status code to indicate how you would like 
    X-Plane to manage the cursor.  If you return xplm_CursorDefault, the SDK 
    will try lower-Z-order plugin windows, then let the sim manage the cursor. 
    
    Note: you should never show or hide the cursor yourself - these APIs are 
    typically reference-counted and thus  cannot safely and predictably be used 
    by the SDK.  Instead return one of xplm_CursorHidden to hide the cursor or 
    xplm_CursorArrow/xplm_CursorCustom to show the cursor. 
    
    If you want to implement a custom cursor by drawing a cursor in OpenGL, use 
    xplm_CursorHidden to hide the OS cursor and draw the cursor using a 2-d 
    drawing callback (after xplm_Phase_Window is probably a good choice).  If 
    you want to use a custom OS-based cursor, use xplm_CursorCustom to ask 
    X-Plane to show the cursor but not affect its image.  You can then use an 
    OS specific call like SetThemeCursor (Mac) or SetCursor/LoadCursor 
    (Windows).

    clicks even if they do nothing if your window appears opaque to the user.)

    callback function and opaque pointer to pass in).  A new hot key ID is 
    returned.  During execution, the actual key associated with your hot key 
    may change, but you are insulated from this.
