 * Terrain Y-Testing
 ___________________________________________________________________________}
{
   The Y-testing API allows you to locate the physical scenery mesh.  This 
   would be used to place dynamic  graphics on top of the ground in a 
   plausible way or do physics interactions. 
   
   The Y-test API works via probe objects, which are allocated by your plugin 
   and used to query terrain. Probe objects exist both to capture which 
   algorithm you have requested (see probe types) and also to cache query 
   information. 
   
   Performance guidelines: It is generally faster to use the same probe for 
   nearby points and different probes for different points. Try not to 
   allocate more than "hundreds" of probes at most.  Share probes if you need 
   more. Generally, probing operations are expensive, and should be avoided 
   via caching when possible. 
   
   Y testing returns a location on the terrain, a normal vectory, and a 
   velocity vector.  The normal vector tells you the slope of the terrain at 
   that point.  The velocity vector tells you if that terrain is moving (and 
   is in meters/second). For example, if your Y test hits the aircraft carrier 
   deck, this tells you the velocity of that point on the deck. 
   
   Note: the Y-testing API is limited to probing the loaded scenery area, 
   which is approximately 300x300 km in X-Plane 9.  Probes outside this area 
   will return the height of a 0 MSL sphere.

    XPLMProbeType defines the type of terrain probe - each probe has a

    called once the object is loaded.  Your refcon is passed back.  The object 
    ref passed in is the newly loaded object (ready for use) or NULL if an 
    error occured. 
    
    If your plugin is disabled, this callback will be delivered as soon as the 
    plugin is re-enabled.  If your plugin is unloaded before this callback is 
    ever called, the SDK will release the object handle for you.

    XPLMLoadObject
    
    This routine loads an OBJ file and returns a handle to it.  If X-plane has 
    already loaded the object, the handle to the existing object is returned.  
    Do not assume you will get the same handle back twice, but do make sure to  
    call unload once for every load to avoid "leaking" objects.  The object 
    will be purged from memory when no plugins and no scenery are using it. 
    
    The path for the object must be relative to the X-System base folder.  If 
    the path is in the root of the X-System folder you may need to prepend ./ 
    to it; loading objects in the root of the X-System folder is STRONGLY 
    discouraged - your plugin should not dump art resources in the root folder! 
    
    
    XPLMLoadObject will return NULL if the object cannot be loaded (either 
    because it is not found or the file is misformatted). This routine will 
    load any object that can be used in the X-Plane scenery system. 
    
    It is important that the datarefs an object uses for animation already be 
    loaded before you load the object.  For this reason it may be necessary to 
    defer object loading until the sim has fully started.

    This routine loads an object asynchronously; control is returned to you 
    immediately while X-Plane loads the object.  The sim will not stop flying 
    while the object loads.  For large objects, it may be several seconds 
    before the load finishes. 
    
    You provide a callback function that is called once the load has completed. 
    Note that if the object cannot be loaded, you will not find out until the 
    callback function is called with a NULL object handle.   
    
    There is no way to cancel an asynchronous object load; you must wait for 
    the load to complete and then release the object if it is no longer

    place you would like the object to be drawn. 
    
    X-Plane will attempt to cull the objects based on LOD and visibility, and 
    will pick the appropriate LOD. 
    
    Lighting is a boolean; pass 1 to show the night version of object with

    earth_relative controls the coordinate system.  If this is 1, the rotations 
    you specify are applied to the object after its coordinate system is 
    transformed from local to earth-relative coordinates -- that is, an object 
    with no rotations will point toward true north and the Y axis will be up 
    against gravity.  If this is 0, the object is drawn with your rotations 
    from local coordanates -- that is, an object with no rotations is drawn 
    pointing down the -Z axis and the Y axis of the object matches the local 
    coordinate Y axis.
